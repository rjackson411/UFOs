# UFOs

## Project Overview
Data visualizations allow us to tell a story with data in a way that is easy for everyone to understand. Easy-to-use visualizations allow everyone, even those with limited data fluency, to interpret data.

## Results
The webpage created displays UFO sighting data with a filter table that allows users to easily filter on various criteria such as date, city, state, and shape of the UFO that was sighted.

## Summary
The webpage has one main advantage in that users can search upon multiple criteria without using a submit button. However, there are also drawbacks. The main draw backs all have to do with the fact that the search options don't provide the available options to search on. The fields are all text boxes which can cause a lot of user errors and confusion as to what to search for.

***Drawbacks***
* The filter method is case sensitive. Therefore if a user entered any items in upper case, the search results would not return properly. For example, if the user entered a city as "Ventura" instead of "ventura", the city would not return in the filtered data. 
* The user may not know exactly what period the data is from, so the user might type in dates that we don't have data for. For the date filter, the user should be able to click through a calendar option instead of a text field.

***Recommendations for further development:***
* Add a calendar selection option for the Date search. 
* Add a drop down menu for the Shape field.
